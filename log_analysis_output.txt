The issue here is that you're trying to use `subprocess.run` without importing it from the `subprocess` module.

To fix this, simply add the following line at the top of your Python file:
```python
import subprocess
```
Alternatively, if you're using a newer version of Python (3.8+), you can import `run` directly from the `subprocess` module without having to use `subprocess.run` explicitly:
```python
from subprocess import run
```
Then, in your code, you can simply use `run(["date"], check=True)`.

Here's an example of how your corrected code might look:
```python
import subprocess

def print_date():
    try:
        subprocess.run(["date"], check=True)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

print_date()
```
Note that I've also added a `try`-`except` block to catch any errors that might occur when running the command. This is good practice when working with external commands, as it allows you to handle any unexpected behavior or errors that might arise.

The issue here is that the `subprocess` module is not imported in your Python script.

To fix this, you need to add an import statement at the top of your script:
```python
import subprocess
```
This will allow you to use the `subprocess.run()` function to execute external commands.

Here's an example of how your corrected code might look:
```python
import subprocess

def print_date():
    # ... (rest of your code remains the same)

    result = subprocess.run(["date"], check=True)
```
Alternatively, you can also import only the `run` function from the `subprocess` module to avoid polluting the namespace:
```python
from subprocess import run

def print_date():
    # ... (rest of your code remains the same)

    result = run(["date"], check=True)
```
Make sure to add this import statement at the top of your script, and you should be able to use `subprocess.run()` without any issues.
